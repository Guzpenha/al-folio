I am a researcher in the field of information retrieval, interested in machine learning, ranking models, recommender systems, and natural language processing. I am currently at the fourth year of my PhD at TU Delft on the topic of conversational search and recommendation, under the supervision of [Claudia Hauff](https://chauff.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

I have BSc and MSc degrees from the department of Computer Science of UFMG, where I was supervised by [Rodrygo Santos](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rodrygo/){:target="_blank"}. I worked as a data scientist for 3 years in Hekima, which was later bought by [iFood to boost AI talent base](https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-unicorn-ifood-announces-acqui-hire-to-boost-ai-talent-base/){:target="_blank"}. 


I am also passionate about photography. Unlike research papers, photographs have no commitment to truth, and to me they serve to fulfill an artistic vision. I am working on my first street photography project, if you are curious check some üñºÔ∏è [here](https://guzpenha.github.io/gallery/){:target="_blank"}.




<!-- I interned at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/){:target="_blank"}'s Alexa Shopping team in 2021, where I did research on explanations for voice product search ([CHI'22](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRsMUhZVan6zGnmaqOsyc5zkxycvjfXA/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} & [CHIIR'22](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePxVcIkZRmnmedWJZu3zV-FaIW6bczki/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}), and I have a research internship planned with [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/){:target="_blank"} for 2022. -->

<!-- I believe my research is best when driven by curiosity. I am intrigued by surprising phenomenas observed in machine learning, and this makes me want to figure out why they happen. For example, when I first read about curriculum learning---a technique inspired by human learning in which you change the order of the training batches so that easy instances come first than hard ones---I could not really grasp why this technique work in the context of training neural networks. This lead me to try to apply this to the topic of my PhD, which resulted in our paper [curriculum learning for IR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08555){:target="_blank"}. After conducting empirical work in the Information Retrieval (IR) domain and thinking about this problem for a while, my intuitive explanation for why curriculum learning works here is that it acts as a filter for batches with uninformative instances: less iterations are spent on 'easy' instances and more iterations are spent on the 'difficult' ones. The study on curriculum learning is one of the ealier papers of my PhD, below you can find a list of selected publications. -->

<!-- To get an idea of my current research a good beginning is with [MANtIS](https://guzpenha.github.io/MANtIS/){:target="_blank"}, a novel dialogue corpus of information-seeking conversations which has a few properties previous datasets lack. We used MANtIS to study how neural rankers for dialogue perform on unseen domains, and how to improve them in the [domain adaptation](https://guzpenha.github.io/guzblog/assets/pdf/Domain_Adaptation_for_CRR_CAIR20.pdf){:target="_blank"} setup. In our ECIR'20 paper we showed that by intelligently sorting the training batches we get more effective neural rankers, i.e. [curriculum learning for IR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08555){:target="_blank"}. Recently, we reflected on the [challenges](https://guzpenha.github.io/guzblog/assets/pdf/Challenges_CONVERSE20.pdf){:target="_blank"} of current offline evaluation schemes for conversational search tasks, discussing a few implicit and explicit assumptions and their implications. On our RecSys'20 [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3412249){:target="_blank"} we explore what types of knowledge off-the-shelf BERT has about recommendation items, e.g. movies and books, with different probes and how to employ such LMs for conversational recommendation.

 I am currently developing a library to conduct experiments with pre-trained transformers, e.g. BERT, for ranking: [**transformer-rankers**](https://guzpenha.github.io/transformer_rankers/){:target="_blank"}. It can be used to train and evaluate a transformer-based model for different ranking tasks, such as passage retrieval, adhoc retrieval and conversation response ranking. Two of my recent papers ([EACL'21](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04356.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [ECIR'21](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08575.pdf){:target="_blank"}) used the library for experimental evaluation. -->
