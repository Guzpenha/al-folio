I am a PhD candidate at TU Delft on the topic of **neural rankers for conversational search and recommendation** under the supervision of [Claudia Hauff](https://chauff.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.  I have BSc and MSc degrees from the Department of Computer Science (DCC) of UFMG - under the supervision of [Rodrygo Santos](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rodrygo/){:target="_blank"}.

To get an idea of my current research check out some of my recent publications: [MANtIS](https://guzpenha.github.io/MANtIS/){:target="_blank"} a novel dialogue corpus of information-seeking conversations which has a few properties previous datasets lack. We used MANtIS to study how neural rankers for dialogue perform on unseen domains, and how to improve then in the [domain adaptation](https://guzpenha.github.io/guzblog/assets/pdf/Domain_Adaptation_for_CRR_CAIR20.pdf){:target="_blank"} setup. In another work, we showed that by intelligently sorting the training batches we get more effective neural rankers: [curriculum learning for IR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08555){:target="_blank"}. Recently, we reflected on the [challenges]((https://guzpenha.github.io/guzblog/assets/pdf/Challenges_CONVERSE20.pdf){:target="_blank"}) of current offline evaluation schemes for conversational search tasks.

 I am currently developing a library to conduct experiments with pre-trained transformers, e.g. BERT, for ranking: [**transformer-rankers**](https://guzpenha.github.io/transformer_rankers/){:target="_blank"}. It can be used to train and evaluate a transformer-based model for different ranking tasks, such as passage retrieval, adhoc retrieval and conversation response ranking.
